# CS50-Final-Project-Stop-Watch

Project Title - Stop Watch


Project Description - For my final project, I was able to code a Stop Watch application which can be used on pc or cell phones. I intergrated lots of colors for visual effects by using CSS and I also made the interactive portiion of the application using JavaScript.
Using my Stop Watch application is simple and easy to use.
Once you hit the start button, the timer will start and increment by 1 every second. Hitting the stop button stops the timer where it is, but it doesn't reset the timer. If you want to resume the timer from where you left off, all you have to do is hit the start button again. This will cause the timer to continue to increase every second by increments of 1. If you are done using the Stop Watch and have satisfied your needs, you can hit the stop button which will stop the timer, then you can hit the reset button, which will reset the Stop Watch back to 0 so it will be ready for it's next use.
I used my HTML to add the 3 buttons displayed under the Stop Watch timer. I also used my HTML to design the actual Stop Watch timer.
For my CSS, I chose to use bright colors as I stated earlier, but I also added a light pulsing effect. With this effect the bright colors alternate between different shades and colors. I also added a box shadow effect to the Stop Watch timer to make it appear as if it's hovering off the page.
To make my 3 buttons interactive I used JavaScript. By using JavaScript I was able to use the onclick function to enable the buttons to be "pushed" and activate their respective functions.
With all these elements combined, I was able to code and bring to life my vision of a simple Stop Watch timer which utilizes all the basic aspects of a web application that is built on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Feel free to use the Stop Watch to time yourself on how long it takes to read this README.
Enjoy.
